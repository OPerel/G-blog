        <p>I'm a Philosopher turned Developer. After devoting the last 8 years of my life to studying subjects such as political philosophy, philosophy of moral, and philosophical and mathematical logic, I decided to try something new. What motivated this decision?</p>
        <p>I think that nowadays everybody should have some minimal understanding of computers and programming (without neglecting their understanding of major philosophical issues of course <span role="img" aria-label="wink">üòâ</span>). On a personal level, after years of concentrating on abstract and unsolvable questions I wanted to do something real, to build something I can see, and can be practical. Even a simple ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù program can be a huge satisfaction.</p>
        <p>I would love to hear from you! Please contact me with any suggestions, comments remarks or  an offer for a front-end developer position‚Ä¶</p>
